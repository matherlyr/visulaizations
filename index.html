  <p>This visualization from Hollywood Insider shows major films from 2008-2015. The y-axis shows the percent budget recovered and x-axis shows the percentage of good reviews on rotten tomatoes. The size of each bubble refelcts this size pf the budget in millions of dollars. The color shows the genre of the movie.<br><br>This is an example of a great visual because it meets all the requirements set forth by Cario. It is truthful because it uses actual data from a credible source (i.e. Rotten Tomatoes). It is functional because it displays the data in a logical way with all the movies on the same scale. It is alsi beautiful because it uses color to display the data. This is also insightful because it compares movie budget recovery to good ratings which is not normally something shown by movie producers or executives. And finally, this visualization is enlightening because it allows viewers to think deeply about how their ratings on movies affects how much of the budget was recovered.<br><br> This expands the island of knowledge because this visualiztion compares data from moives in a new a differnet way.</p>

  </div> 

<div class=writing> 

  <p>This visualization shows how baby boomers describe themselves. This, however, is an example of a poor visualization. It does not seem to be truthful because the percentage do not add up to 100%. It does not seem functional either because the 61% area looks larger than the 78% area. It is somewhat beautiful, but the teal at the top of the visual and the blue at bottom of the visual are pretty similar in color. Also, this visual is not very insightful because people have done surveys similar to this in the past and created visuals that are much more informative. And finally, it is not very enlightening because how people think of themselves can change overtime.<br><br> This one does not expand the island of knowledge because it is not something new. People have done similar things in the past.</p>
